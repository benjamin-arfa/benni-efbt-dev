<h1>Make Final Manual Edits to Generated Python Code</h1>

<p>
    <b> description under construction</b><br><br>
    
    Although PyBIRD AI generates about 95% of the code we need for generation rules, we need to complete the last 5% maunally <br><br>
    This is because we have flexibility in how we define the Joins of tables on the input layer data <br><br>
    Do the edits to the generated python joins code as required <b>(This step is to be documented further)</b><br><br> 
    
    We then need to move the generated files to the correct locations<br><br>
    The report_cells.py file form the birds_nest\results\generated_python_filters folder should be moved to the birds_nest\pybirdai\process_steps\filter_code folder.<br><br> 
    All generated python files from the birds_nest\results\generated_python_joins folder should be moved to the birds_nest\pybirdai\process_steps\filter_code folder.<br><br> 
    All generated html files from the birds_nest\results\generated_html  folder should be moved to the birds_nest\pybirdai\templates\pybirdai folder.<br><br>
